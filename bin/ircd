# This is the configuration. Edit from here down.
#
# HOW TO USE THIS FILE:
#
# This file is, strictly speaking, a Ruby script. We've provided
# methods that allow the configuration to be simple and human-readable.
# Anything that works in Ruby will technically work here, but we
# suggest sticking with the basics unless you know what you're doing.
#
# Unquoted strings are interpreted as Ruby statements. Numbers do not
# need to be encapsulted within quotes. If your string is basic alphanumeric
# you can use a :symbol (prefixing your string with a colon instead of
# encapsulting it with quotations) as it is less noisy.
#
configure do

  # The name of our server
  name 'irc.malkier.net'

  # How much logging should we do?
  # In order of least verbose to most verbose:
  # none, fatal, error, warning, info, debug
  #
  logging :info

  # Define ports the IRCd should listen on for incoming
  # user connections. You may optionally provide an IP/host
  # to bind to. The default is to bind to all hosts.
  #
  listen 6667
  listen 6668, '127.0.0.1'

  # This is here to make sure you're paying attention.
  #abort "You didn't read your configuration!"

  # There's a special type of user called an operator. These users
  # are allowed certain privileges on the network and are required
  # to manage network connections and malicious users.
  #
  operator :rakaur, :flags => :admin do

    # The user's password. These passwords are stored encrypted, and may be
    # generated using the `mkpasswd` utility included. Alternatively, any
    # utility that encrypts using DES can be used.

    password 'WXFUd2cPT3u9g'
