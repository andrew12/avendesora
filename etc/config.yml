# This file is written in YAML. I decided to go with it over the
# complex C-style configuration in synapse for a few reasons:
#
#   1) It's very simple.
#   2) Ruby can parse it with one method call rather than an entire library.
#   3) It's very Ruby-ish instead of C-ish, and that's what I'm going for.
#

# What's the server's name?
name: irc.malkier.net
