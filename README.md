This is a hobby project to write a fast IRCd in Ruby. From Ruby we get code
clarity and conciseness and dynamicness and from EventMachine we get speed
and reliability and from Rubinius we get robustness and even more speed.

Don't expect fast and sweeping development. I don't have that kind of time.

The configuration file is the executable: `bin/ircd`
